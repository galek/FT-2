Note: You are free to do what you want with scripts of this mission 
without asking any permissions but with specifying of the script origin. 
(Though I can say all of this only about my scripts - not about scripts
 of another coders.)

The only requirement: if you make some changes to mission don't forget 
also to change name to show mission is not original and has your changes.
And don't please remove original authors names from mission start screen
